Pt.1: a Sneakerhead

As a [who] sneakerhead, which means someone who loves sneaker culture and collects or trades sneakers as a hobby,
[when] I want to check out and understand the current sneaker trend [where] online, I [what] need to get the infomation
about 

1.which sneakers are the most popular ones and 

2.whether they are worthy, 

because [why] 

1.sometimes what is really popular is not something out there on the billboard but something not shown. 

2.only then do I know which pair of sneakers worth purchasing and which pairs should I purchase.


Pt.2: a sneaker seller

As a [who] sneaker seller, [when] new sneakers are released or there is a change of people's taste, some
new sneaker technology is released or what's the worst, some shoes get real bad quality problems and got exposed, I [what]
have to get the information quickly since I wanna know what young people want to buy most and how they really feel about my
products, because [why] what they buy, honestly, depends on how they feel about some shoes, what their little circle of people
feel cool, and how they are influenced by the advertisements. If I have that fresh and solid guidance in mind, 
I can
1. acquire the real feedback from my consumers and 

2. quickly increase/decrease my inventory of some particular pair of shoes
